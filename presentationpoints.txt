want to quantify probability of collision
Astar not equal to safest path
Using a single Gaussian may not represent the path well enough, especially in convex regions
Don't know obstacle constraints in work space. Our planning algorithms generally rely on a collision checker

pqprave collision distance to obstacles
Don't check self collisions


Distance to obstacle check is slow!

Pros and cons of my approach:
pro: more accurate than analytical uses collision checker

Con: sampling is slow
EKF. Linearization
