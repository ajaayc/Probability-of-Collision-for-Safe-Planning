Quasi Monte Carlo Sampling (Sigma points)
Smarter Monte Carlo Sampling
Truncation via Unscented Transform. Let the nonlinear function be a collision checker that makes particle crash into obstacle
Gaussian Mixture model approach (sampling is expensive though)
Dynamic programming to speed up collision checks
Form constraints in workspace by finding robot radius



Things to think about:
Do we want an average or worst case probability of collision?
