\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%Many purport that robotic caregivers might reduce the amount of human contact that the elderly have, yielding more comfort for human caregivers than the cared. Others argue that robotic caregivers can lead to objectification of the elderly, inciting a feeling of powerlessness among those who receive care.

%

\IEEEPARstart{T}he use of robots in elderly care is becoming increasingly likely throughout the world, as the population of elderly people is beginning to overtake the number of potential caregivers. This phenomenon is becoming particularly evident in Japan, where low birth rates and long life expectancy seem to contribute to a rapidly aging population. In 2009, it was found that approximately 22\% of the Japanese population was over the age of 65 years old. This estimate is projected to increase to approximately 34\% by 2035 \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}. The Japanese government is responding to this situation by increasing funding for research into robotic caregivers as a means to manage the rising subpopulation of elderly individuals.

The United States and Europe are facing a similar problem. In particular, in the United States, 12.8\% of the population are over the age of 65, and this number is expected to rise to around 20\% by 2030 \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}. It may be likely that the United States could follow the Japanese lead into robot care.

Development of robotic caregivers for the elderly raises several questions:
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Will robotic caregivers replace human caregivers?
\item Can robotic caregivers provide the same quality of care as human caregivers?
\item Can robotic caregivers ethically emulate the ``warm'' care that is expected of human caregivers, potentially deceiving vulnerable human beings? \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}
\end{enumerate}

As the world's scientists and engineers attempt to provide care for the rising elderly population in the form of robotic caregivers, we must think carefully about these questions and more. However, before we proceed to look at the ethical concerns that arise from enabling robotic caregivers for the elderly, we must look at where we are now. What is the current state of robotic caregiver research and development?

\section{Robotic Caregivers Today}
Robotic solutions today for care of the elderly are varied in their goals. Some robots address many of the physiological and functional needs of older people, such as helping with daily chores and assisting with issues of mobility and safety. Other robots are designed to meet the companionship needs of elderly, providing mental stimulation and emotional connection. A third category of robots monitors elderly individuals' activities--especially those with mental disorders, such as dementia \cite{IEEEhowto:robinson}. We proceed to look at a few examples of robots from each of these categories. Some robots overlap within each of these categories. 


\subsection{Assistance Robots}
Assistance robots are designed to assist elderly individuals with navigation and tasks around their homes. For example, the Guido robot, which was developed by researchers in Dublin, can assist frail and visually impaired individuals by navigating them through the environment. A robot called HIRB assists older people in bathing. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are developing COACH, a robot that would help people perform simple tasks such as hand washing \cite{IEEEhowto:robinson}. These are just a few examples of development of robots that provide physical assistance to elderly individuals in their daily living.

\subsection{Companionship Robots}
Companionship robots are designed to mentally stimulate and prove an emotional connection to the elderly. In general, companionship robots evoke a positive impact on the elderly. For example, Paro, a mechanical seal, and AIBO, a dog-like robot, have been shown to decrease depression and loneliness in older people after they interact with these robots in nursing home settings. Analysis of the market for Paro has shown that most individuals purchase Paro because,''they could not keep pets, the robot cannot get sick and the robot is easy to take care of, cute and can be hugged''\cite{IEEEhowto:robinson}. Similarly research with owners of the AIBO dog robot has shown how people can become attached to the robot as if it were a pet, yielding social rapport  and other psychological benefits. The technology for both Paro and AIBO has been shown to have a small learning curve and it is not overwhelming \cite{IEEEhowto:robinson}.

\subsection{Monitoring Robots}
Monitoring robots tend to passively observe elderly individuals. For example, the ALISA robot can monitor physiological symptoms and falls. The Pearl robot can monitor health and provide appointment reminders for elderly. The Hector robot reminds individuals to take medications and sends health information to a health practitioner \cite{IEEEhowto:robinson}. With many of these robots, there comes an issue of privacy, as the individuals who are being monitored must consent to monitoring. Assessing consent can cause an ethical dilemma in the case of individuals with dementia, who may not be willing to consent to being watched.

\section{Ethical Concerns}
Development of robotic caregivers, in the form of assistance, companionship, and monitoring robots, invites us to consider the ethical implications of enabling such robots to care for the elderly. We proceed to examine several of these questions below:

\subsubsection{Reduced Social Interaction as Cruelty}
Social interaction can have a measurable impact on the health and well-being of
the elderly. Statistically, adults who do not participate in regular social interaction are more susceptible to depression. Given the prospect of robotic caretakers potentially eliminating much of the duties of human caretakers, we are faced with a question: Is depriving the elderly of social interaction a form of cruelty--an unethical act \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}? In other words, if human caregivers could be completely replaced with robotic caregivers, would that be an ethical execution? The answer to these questions becomes even more interesting when we consider companion robots. Can companion robots in particular replace human interaction? 

\subsubsection{Objectification of the Elderly}
The objectification of the elderly--especially individuals with dementia--becomes an interesting topic when we consider robotic caretakers. In particular, there is a question of who controls the robots: the elderly person or the caring facilities? Assistance robots that execute tasks, such as feeding and lifting, can reduce the workload of human carers; however, they can cause the elder people to feel less control over their lives than when they are cared for by humans. Sharkey and Sharkey assert that, ``If robots were to be used by human carers to lift and move elderly people insensitively, the well-being of those elderly people would be likely to be reduced'' \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}. This reduction in well-being would stem from the elderly individuals feeling that they are just objects to be managed by the robotic caregivers.

\subsubsection{Roles and Tasks}
What exactly should the role of a robot be in the caregiving process? What tasks should and should not be automated by robotic caregivers \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}? Questions such as these are raised when we consider how robotic caregivers may synergize (or not synergize) with human caregivers.

\subsubsection{Limits of Personal Autonomy}
Development of assistive robots raises ethical concerns regarding how much autonomy an elderly person should be allowed to have. The amount of potential autonomy may significantly depend on medical assessments of medical ability \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}. Should an assistive robot watch and intervene in most of the decisions and actions of the elderly individual that it is caring for? Surely an assistive robot may want to intervene if an individual with dementia wants to jump off of a balcony. However, what if an individual wants to pursue a mundane and potentially dangerous action, e.g. standing on a chair to reach for an item on a shelf? When should a robotic caregiver intervene?

\subsubsection{Accountability}
There is also a question of who should be held accountable if a robotic caregiver does not perform its duty and causes injury or damage e.g. if it accidentally drops a senior citizen onto the floor or crashes them into a wall \cite{IEEEhowto:sharkey}. Who should take responsibility? The robot? The manufacturer? The senior citizen who provided the command to the robot?

\subsubsection{Deception}
The question of deception arises as we examine companion robots, which would serve as social companions to the elderly. Is it ethical for a robot to mimic human emotion and socially engage with the elderly? If it is deception, is it justifiable \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}? Some argue that if a companion robot can meet the emotional needs of an elderly individual, then the ends justify the means.

\subsubsection{Trust}
If human caregivers were to withdraw completely from their jobs in favor of robotic caregivers, can we trust robotic caregivers to properly meet all needs of an elderly individual \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}? In other words, how much can we trust robotic caretakers to perform their assigned roles?

\subsubsection{Privacy}
In the case of monitoring robots, there is an ethical dilemma regarding privacy. What data can be collected from monitoring elderly individuals? How is the data stored, and who has permission to access the monitoring records? Who owns the records and for how long \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}? In the United States, these questions are addressed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Inserting stipulations for monitoring robots into HIPAA may be tricky.


\section{Ethics in Future Development}
The ethical concerns associated with the introduction of robotic caregivers makes it evident that we must embed ethics in automated caregiver research projects. In future development, we must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration between robotic caregiver researchers and clinicians
\item Form a common framework for cross-disciplinary teams to answer ethical questions for robotic caregiver development
\end{enumerate}
We proceed to look at each of these goals.

\subsection{Collaboration}
Stahl and Coekelbergh assert that ethicists can collaborate with developers directly in the form of an ongoing dialogue about ethics during the research project; all researchers would be involved in this dialogue. Ethical issues raised by the interaction between elderly individuals and robotic caregivers would be addressed as part of research projects, inciting cooperation between robotics researchers, psychologists, and clinicians \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}. However, this plan of action may be difficult to implement when cross-disciplinary collaboration is sparse among robotics researchers and clinicians.

\subsection{Ethical Framework}
If a cross-disciplinary collaborative team of researchers could be established, it would need to address how research into robotic caregivers matches a standard ethical framework. What is the best ethical framework to pursue as we continue future development in robotic caregivers? Stahl and Coekelbergh are proponents of a standard ethical framework, which would give researchers, funders, policymakers, and representatives from industry a set of questions worth exploring as they pursue their development. They term this framework ``AREA,'' which is an acronym for Anticipate, Reflect, Engage, and Act \cite{IEEEhowto:stahl}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Anticipate
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the planned research methodology acceptable?
\end{itemize}
\item Reflect
\begin{itemize}
\item  Which mechanisms are used to reflect on process?
\end{itemize}
\item Engage
\begin{itemize}
\item How can we engage a wide group of stakeholders?
\end{itemize}

The framework consists of a wider set of scaffolding questions to permit researchers to efficiently discuss the ethical implications of robotic caregivers for the elderly.

\section{Conclusion}
Robotic caregiver development continues as many societies consider the rise of the elderly population and the reduction of potential caregivers. In this paper, we have examined a set of ethical concerns that are related to the introduction of robotic caregivers. Furthermore, we have looked at future directions to ensure that these ethical questions are considered. We have established that more cross-disciplinary collaboration between robotics researchers and other stakeholders would be necessary. We have also briefly examined a framework for a research team to consider as they address these ethical questions during the future development of robotic caregivers.

Development of caregiving solutions is still in its infancy. As we continue development, we must tailor our actions towards ensuring the dignity and autonomy of the elderly individuals who may be cared for.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
