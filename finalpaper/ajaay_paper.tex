% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Estimating Probability of Collision}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
We consider a robot operating in an environment with obstacles.% Our goal is to quantify the safety of a motion plan prior to its execution by the robot's controller. We quantify the safety of a plan via the probability that the robot will experience a collision while executing the plan.
The motion model of the robot is given as:
$$x_{t+1} = g(x_{t-1}, u_{t-1}, m), m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,R_t)$$
where $x_t \in \mathcal{C}$ is the configuration of the robot at time $t$, $u_t \in\mathbb{R}^{n_u}$ is the applied control input, and $m$ is a zero-mean Gaussian noise variable with variance $R_t$.

During execution of the motion plan, the robot obtains measurements of surrounding landmarks. The sensor model of the robot is given as:
$$z_t = h(x_t,l,n), n \sim \mathcal{N}(0,Q_t)$$
where $z_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_z}$ is the measurement obtained at time $t$, $l \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l}$ is the location of the landmark that is observed, and $n$ is a zero-mean Gaussian noise variable with variance $Q_t$.

We assume the existence of a nominal plan computed by a motion planner. The nominal plan is defined by:
$$[x_0^*,u_0^*,...,x_N^*,u_N^*]$$
where $x_t^* = g(x_{t-1}^*,u_{t-1}^*,0)$ for $0 < t \leq N$ , where $N$ is the number of configurations in the motion plan.

With the preliminary notation established, we express our problem statement. Our goal is to estimate the probability of collision $p_c$ for the nominal plan. More formally, this probability is represented as:
$$p_c = p\left(\[ \bigvee\limits_{t=0}^N x_t^* \notin \mathcal{C}_F \]\right)$$
where $\mathcal{C}_F \subset \mathcal{C}$ represents the space of non-colliding configurations.

\subsection{Formulation and Assumptions}

Much of existing literature on this subect assumes that we can represent obstacles in the environment as known constraints on the robot's feasible locations in the workspace. However, we do not make that assumption, and we assume that there instead exists a collision checker $\phi: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \{\text{TRUE},\text{FALSE}\}$, which can determine if a configuration is in collision. If $x\notin \mathcal{C}_F$, $\phi(x) = \text{TRUE}$; otherwise $\phi(x) = \text{FALSE}$ \cite{IEEEhowto:lavalle}.

The assumption of an available collision checker contrasts our formulation from other literatures, which tend to only consider point robots through the formulation of known robot location constraints based on obstacles. Our formulation lets us consider the possibility of non-point robots, whose locations in the workspace may cause collisions with obstacles due to the robots having 3D-geometries and being situated with complex orientations.

We assume that the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) localization algorithm \cite{IEEEhowto:thrun} is used to compute $\hat{x_t}$, an estimate of the robot's true configuration, $x_t$, at time $t$. The covariance of the EKF estimate of $x_t$ is given by $\Sigma_t$. We assume that there is a set  of already known landmarks in the environment, $L = {l_1,...,l_{n_l}}$, where $n_l$ is the number of landmarks, and that data association between sensor measurements and landmarks is known.
%and that at each time $t$, the robot will receive measurements for all landmarks.

Due to the Gaussian noise in the motion model, we expect that the robot will deviate from the nominal motion plan during its execution. To compensate for the motion uncertainty, we assume that the robot operates with a closed-loop feedback controller \cite{IEEEhowto:stengel}. We assume that there exists a linear feedback control law that operates on the EKF estimate of the robot configuration and attempts to keep the robot close to the nominal plan. This feedback policy is given as:% related to the deviation of the estimate of the robot's configuration, $\hat{x_t}$, from the nominal configuration, $x_t^*$ as:
$$\bar{u_t} = L_{t+1}(\hat{x_t} - x_t^*) $$
where $L_{t}$ is the control gain matrix, which is contingent on the choice of feedback controller \cite{IEEEhowto:stengel} and $\bar{u_t}$ is the necessary deviation from the nominal control input $u_t^*$ to account for the robot's deviation from the nominal plan. It follows that $u_t = \bar{u_t} + u_t^*$, where $u_t$ represents the true control input to be executed by the robot--given the deviation of the robot's estimated configuration $\hat{x_t}$ from the nominal configuration $x_t^*$.

\subsection{Sources of Difficulty}
Computing the probability of collision for a motion plan in practice is a difficult task. There are three key sources of the difficulty:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Uncertainty in robot motion and sensor models
\item Dependent individual events of collision
\item Computational time of Monte-Carlo simulations
\end{enumerate}

We proceed to describe each of these sources.
\subsubsection{Model Uncertainty}
Robot motion is often corrupted by noise. We find that when we command a robot to follow a nominal control input, it often does not follow the command exactly due to various factors--usually wheel slippage due to lack of uniformity of surfaces.

Furthermore, sensor measurements that are used to localize a robot are also corrupted by natural noise and innaccuracy. Using sensor measurements for localization naturally causes uncertainty in the robot's known position. When using a state estimate as an input to a feedback control loop to correct the robot's position, there is a subsequent uncertainty in the accuracy of the desired controller adjustment--despite the desired intention of following the nominal motion plan.

\subsubsection{Dependence between Collision Events}
A key feature of this problem is that the event of a collision not occurring at a configuration $x_t$ of a motion plan is \underline{not} independent of the event of a collision not occurring at previous configurations of the motion plan. More formally:
$$p(x_t \in \mathcal{C}_F) \neq p\left(x_t \in \mathcal{C}_F | \bigwedge\limits_{i=0}^{t-1} x_i \in \mathcal{C}_F \right)$$

Prior approaches to solving this problem {\color{red}{cite here}} often consider the events of collisions along the motion plan to be independent of each other, which can lead to an overly conservative estimate of the probability of collision for a motion plan. Incorporating the fact that the collision events (and non-collision events) are dependent on each other increases the difficultly of computing an accurate estimate of the probability of collision.

\subsubsection{Computational Time of Monte-Carlo Simulations}

Running a large number of Monte-Carlo simulation, each having a large number of particles, can--in theory--give the true probability of collision for a motion plan. The idea of a Monte-Carlo simulation is to simulate the motion of thousands of particles, each particle representing a potential configuration of a robot's configuration given uncertainty in the robot's true configuration $x_t$. By finding the proportion of particles that did not collide with obstacles at all during the entirety of a motion plan, we can have an estimate of the probability of collision.

However, a single Monte-Carlo simulation is generally not sufficient, and we would need to average the proportions of colliding-particles across hundreds or even thousands of Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain an accurate estimate of the true probability of collision for the motion plan.

Furthermore, running a single Monte-Carlo simulation with thousands of particles can be very computationally expensive due to the compounding of time required for collision checking. Running thousands of Monte-Carlo simulations compounds the computation time even further, causing this approach to be a poor idea in practice.% In this case, computing the probability of collision for a motion plan would often require more time than that of computing the actual motion plan!

%This work attempts to enter the conversation regarding

\subsection{Metric Evaluation}
Given the sources of difficulty for this problem, we primarily strive to compute an \underline{accurate} estimate of the true probability of collision for a motion plan. We also seek to compute the probability of collision for the plan in an amount of time that is approximately less than or equal to the time required for a single Monte-Carlo simulation while within the error bounds of the average proportion of colliding particles that would be computed from executing hundreds of Monte-Carlo simulations with many particles in each simulation instance.

\caption{Propagation and Truncation of State Estimate Distribution. Figure borrowed from Patil, van den Berg, Alterovitz 2012. ``The probabilities of collision at each stage of the plan are conditioned on the previous stages being collision free. We truncate a priori distributions with respect to obstacles to discount plan executions that collide with obstacles (black disks). Propagating the truncated distributions (black ellipses) accounts for only the collision free samples (red disks), resulting in accurate estimation of the probability of collision. Using the unconditional distributions (gray ellipses) to estimate the collision probability results in a very conservative estimate.''\cite{IEEEhowto:patil}}

\section{Method}
We propose a sampling-based method paired with the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to estimate the probability of collision for a motion plan. Our method adopts ideas from the the approach proposed by Patil, van den Berg, and Alterovitz \cite{IEEEhowto:patil}. However, our approach differs in that we do not assume that the environment obstacles can be represented as constraints on the robot location in the workspace, and we assume that a collision checker exists instead.

Figure \ref{patil_figure} portrays the approach recognized in \cite{IEEEhowto:patil}, which estimates the probability of collision for a motion plan by propagating a Kalman Filter (KF) estimate of a robot's state and truncating the distribution of the estimate with respect to obstacles. Patil et al. make the observation that the distribution of the robot's configuration at a timestep $t$--conditioned on the configuration $x_i \notin \mathcal{C}_F$, $\forall i, 0 \leq i < t $ being collision-free, can be represented by truncating the KF estimate at $x_t$ with respect to the obstacles. They also note that the proportion of the distribution that has been truncated by the obstacles would represent the conditional probability of collision for that state of the motion plan.

The approach of Patil et al. is purely analytical. It truncates the KF estimate of the robot state by sequentially applying each obstacle constraint to truncate the Gaussian distribution of the state estimate using analytical techniques from existing literature. They assume that the truncation of a Gaussian distribution by the obstacle constraints subsequently yields another Gaussian distribution.

The approach of Patil et al. makes two more important assumptions that are worth noting when they truncate the KF estimate with respect to obstacles:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The obstacles in the environment can be expressed as linear constraints on the robot's location in the workspace
  \item The free region containing the robot's configuration at time $t$ is convex
\end{enumerate}

We base our approach on the framework of \cite{IEEEhowto:patil}, and attempt to release these assumptions as we define our sampling-based GMM approach to estimate the probability of collision.

\section{Conclusion}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]

% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
