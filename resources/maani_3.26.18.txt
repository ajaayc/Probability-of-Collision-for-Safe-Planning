Transformation from sphere to ellipse. See lecture notes 568.
Affine transformation will scale shape to ellipse. Scaling to to new space makes problem easier.

Chi-squared test. plan for worst case distance. If you can pass chi square test with some safety region e.g. 90%. Chi-squared test tells how far to search for obstacles. For a conservative estimate, find all obstacles in that region. If any, see if they pass that conservative test. 80% may be ok. chi square generalizes beyond multiple dimensions. If all points in ellipse pass chi squared test.

If nothing around estimator of robot. Then ok. Want to go for the worst case.
